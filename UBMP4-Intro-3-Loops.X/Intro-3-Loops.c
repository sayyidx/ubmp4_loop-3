 This example program demonstrates the use of while and for loop structures to
 change the brightness of LEDs using PWM (Pulse-Width Modulated) signals.
 
 Additional program analysis and programming activities expand the use of loops
 to create tones of different pitches and frequency sweeps.

/* Program Analysis
 * 
 * 1. The main part of the program contains the 'while(1)' loop. What condition
 *    is being evaluated within its brackets? (Hint: Think about the Boolean
 *    variables from Activity 2-Variables.) How many times will this loop run?
 * 
 * 2. There is a second 'while(PWMperiod != 0)' loop inside the first while
 *    loop. What condition is being evaluated inside this while statement's
 *    brackets? How many times will the contents of this inner loop run?
 * 
 * 3. What condition is being evaluated by the if statement inside the loop?
 *    What happens when the if condition is true?
 * 
 * 4. Pressing the up or down buttons (SW3 and SW2) will increase or decrease
 *    the brightness of LED D4 using PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation). How many 
 *    different brightnesses can the LED have? What would the step size of one
 *    brightness level change be if it was expressed as a percentage?
 * 
 * 5. The while loop needs three statements to perform its function. First, the
 *    assignment statement 'PWMperiod = 255;' sets the PWMperiod variable. Next,
 *    the condition 'while(PWMperiod != 0)' runs the contents of the loop code
 *    while the condition is true. Unlike if statements, in which program flow
 *    continues below the contents of the if structure, the while loop causes
 *    the condition to be re-evaluated after executing the contents of its code.
 *    To ensure that the while loop does end at some point, the assignment
 *    statement 'PWMperiod --;' modifies the variable from within the loop.
 *    When the condition is false, the loop terminates and the program continues
 *    running the code below the loop structure.
 * 
 *    A 'for' loop is an alternative to a while loop, and incorporates the
 *    assignment of the loop variable, the loop conditional check, and variable
 *    modification into a single statement as shown in the example code. Replace
 *    the entire while structure in the code with the following for structure:
        
        // PWM LED4 brightness
        for(unsigned char PWMperiod = 255; PWMperiod != 0; PWMperiod --)
        {
            if(TonLED4 == PWMperiod)
            {
                LED4 = 1;
            }
            __delay_us(20);
        }
        LED4 = 0;
        
 *    What is an advantage of using a for loop instead of a while loop?
 * 
 * 6. The 'for' loop, above, redefines the PWMperiod variable in the 
 *    initialization statement: 'for(unsigned char PWMperiod = 255; ...'
 * 
 *    This instance of the PWMperiod variable will be local to the for loop,
 *    and won't maintain its value outside of the loop, or alter the value of
 *    the existing PWMperiod variable. It's a bad idea to re-use variable names
 *    inside loops since having two different versions of the same variable
 *    creates confusion. Is this really the case? Let's prove that the global
 *    PWMperiod variable is not affected by the local PWMperiod variable
 *    inside the for loop. Add this line above the for loop:
 
        PWMperiod = 128;

 *    Next, add the following lines after the for loop:
        
        if(PWMperiod == 128)
        {
            LED5 = 1;
        }
        else
        {
            LED5 = 0;
        }
        
 *    Compile and run the code. When the program runs, the PWMperiod variable
 *    inside the for loop will count down from 255 to 0, and should be 0 when
 *    the loop finishes. Is LED D5 lit? What must the value of PWMperiod be?
 * 
 *    Can you remove the global PWMperiod variable definition from the top of 
 *    the program now that PWMperiod is being defined in the for loop?
 * 
 * 7. Add this code below the PWM loop to generate a tone:
                
        // Change pitch
        if(SW4 == 0)
        {
            period -= 1;
        }
        
        if(SW5 == 0)
        {
            period += 1;
        }
        
        // Make a tone
        for(unsigned char cycles = 50; cycles != 0; cycles--)
        {
            BEEPER = !BEEPER;
            for(unsigned int p = period; p != 0; p--);
        }

 *    The section to make a tone contains nested for loops. The outer loop 
 *    repeatedly causes the BEEPER pin to toggle before the inner loop runs.
 *    The inner loop is an empty loop, shown by its trailing semicolon ';'. It
 *    contains no code, so nothing will be repeated, but exists only to add a
 *    time delay to our program. The higher the number of loops, the more
 *    instruction cycles it will take to decrement the loop counter variable
 *    to zero, increasing the time delay until the next cycle.
 * 
 *    What variable type is period? How large a number can this variable hold?
 * 
 * 8. Why is period copied to the local variable p inside the inner for loop?
 *    What would happen if the actual period variable was decremented instead?
 * 
 * Programming Activities
 * 
 * 1. Pressing and holding SW2 or SW3 causes the brightness of LED D4 to cycle
 *    through its entire brightness range. Modify the code so that pressing and
 *    holding SW2 will dim the LED until it is off and then keep if off, and
 *    pressing and holding SW3 will brighten the LED and keep it at maximum
 *    brightness.
 * 
 * 2. Modify your program to control the brightness of LED D5 using SW4 and SW5
 *    while using SW3 and SW2 to control LED D4. Hint: To ensure each LED can
 *    reach maximum brightness (100% PWM on-time), you'll have to perform both
 *    PWM functions in the same loop. You can see the resulting PWM wave if you
 *    have access to an oscilloscope. If not, just light the other two LEDs and 
 *    compare the brightness of LEDs D4 and D5 to them.
 * 
 * 3. Rather than having lights suddenly turn on at full brightness, or motors
 *    turn on at full power, create a program that uses a for loop and your PWM
 *    code to make a 'soft-start' program that slowly increases the PWM on-time
 *    when you press a button. Can you make it turn off in a similar way?
 * 
 * 4. Make a program that creates an automated, electronic 'pulse', repeatedly
 *    brightening and dimming one or more LEDs.
 * 
 * 5. Make a 'chirp' or 'pew-pew' sound effect by sweeping through a range of
 *    frequencies when a button is pressed.
